# IITB - Data Science Datathon

I took part in a four week long Data Science bootcamp which was organized by the IIT Bombay Analytics club in association with Dphi.

### WEEK 1
First week was just an introduction to python programming language and it's framework like Pandas, Numpy and MatplotLib. These tools are must for a person starting his/her journey in the field of Data Science. These tools comes in handy while performing exploratory data analysis of a dataset.

### WEEK 2
In this week we get to apply the learnings of the past week into a real world dataset in which we made different visualization using the MatplotLib library of the python. Also, learning material which was focused on introduction to Linear Algebra and statistics was included in this week's learning material. After this we learned about feature importance and how much they weight they have if one want's to build a high performance machine learning model. Techniques to handle data imbalance and regularization were also taught in this week's learning material along with the thorough understanding of their importance.

### WEEK 3
This week was devoted for revision and clearing backlog if any. This helped us a lot to revise and soak in all the advanced concepts which has been taught in this short span of two weeks.

### WEEK 4
In this week we get to work with some of the state of the art machine learning model. Cost functions which helps a model to optimize its parameter to fit the given input features. When we work with model's like decision tree or random forest then we must know about the hyperparameter tunign else model will face the problem of overfitting due to which model will perform with higher accuracy on the training data but perform very poorly on the test or previously unseen data.

In this challenge we were supposed to develop a classifier which can predict the political party which would be liked by a family based on some input features which include some features regarding physical, financial and educational background of the family. But this dataset was incomplete due to which maximum score achieved was <code>50%</code> on this dataset. My submission scored <code>35%</code> accuracy on this dataset.
